This is my first NextJS project. I've used it to learn NextJS and Tailwind CSS. I've also used it to showcase my projects.

Gotta say, NextJS is pretty awesome. As it's a React framework, it was very easy to switch.

### Repository

You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/hristokoev/portfolio/).

### Further Development

I'm planning to add more projects (that is, if I have more projects to add ðŸ˜…) and a contact form. Additionally, I need to update the main page and tell more about myself, my skills and not yet sure about this, but my rates as well.

## Technologies used

* NextJS (React)
* Tailwind CSS
* Vercel for deployment
