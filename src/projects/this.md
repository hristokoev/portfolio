### Technologies used

* NextJS (React)
* Tailwind CSS
* Vercel for deployment

### Introduction

This is my first NextJS project. It was a bit overdue to have my own website and I've used this opportunity to learn NextJS.

Gotta say, NextJS is pretty awesome. As it's a React framework, it was very easy to switch.

### Repository

You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/hristokoev/portfolio/).

### Further Development

I'm planning to add more projects (that is, if I have more projects to add ðŸ˜…) and a contact form. Additionally, I need to find a way to update the projects without having to redeploy the website every time.
