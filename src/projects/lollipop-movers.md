### Introduction

![Lollipop Movers](/images/lollipop-movers/thumb.jpg)

[Lollipop Movers](https://lollipopmovers.nl/)

Lollipop Movers is a moving company based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. They needed a website to showcase their services and allow customers to request a quote.

### My Role

I was hired as a freelance developer to build the website. I was responsible for the design, development, and deployment of the website.

In reality, this was my first real React project.

### Further Development

~~For now though, it's a work in progress. Currently I'm developing the admin panel for easier management of the requests.~~

~~Seeing the power of NextJS, next thing on the list is to migrate the website to NextJS.~~

October 2023: The client reached out to me and asked me to integrate the form with [Privyr](https://www.privyr.com/). This means that I need to handle API requests. I was planning to move everything to NextJS, however, now I believe that to be an overkill. For this static website, I'll be using Astro instead.

Astro is fun. ðŸŽ‰
