### Introduction

[Lollipop Movers](https://lollipopmovers.nl/)

Lollipop Movers is a moving company based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. They needed a website to showcase their services and allow customers to request a quote.

### My Role

I was hired as a freelance developer to build the website. I was responsible for the design, development, and deployment of the website.

In reality, this was my first real React project.

### Further Development

For now though, it's a work in progress. Currently I'm developing the admin panel for easier management of the requests.

Seeing the power of NextJS, next thing on the list is to migrate the website to NextJS.
