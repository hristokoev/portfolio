### Introduction

Catrice Cosmetics had published a contest on Talenthouse, looking for a video ad for their new cosmetics line. I decided to give it a try and this is what I came up with after a few days of playing around with After Effects:

<video width="600" height="600" controls>
  <source src="/videos/catrice-cosmetics/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Another version:

<video width="600" height="600" controls>
  <source src="/videos/catrice-cosmetics/video2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

...and I won first place! So yeah, now I can say I'm an award winning video editor ðŸ˜Ž
