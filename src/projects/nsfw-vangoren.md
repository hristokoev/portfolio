## Introduction

Enter VANGOREN, a network of adult websites that I've been working on in 2022. It's a network of 10+ websites, all of which are built on the same platform. The platform is built on top of **ElevatedX**, a popular adult CMS.

Skipping the details on how I found the job (it's a long story ðŸ˜…), I was hired as a full-stack developer to work on the network. My main responsibilities were to implement a new design for the websites, add new features, and fix bugs.

The network was built years ago and it was in desperate need of a do-over. The websites were not responsive, the code was outdated, and the design was not user- and SEO-friendly.

## My Role

This, in reality, was my first "big" project that I spent a few months working on. Back then I didn't even know what full-stack meant. I only knew more or less what needs to be done and I used my Google skills to find solutions. So I entered into this world of adult websites with no prior experience and I had to learn everything from scratch. I had to learn how to work with **ElevatedX**, how to work with **NATS**, how to work with **PHP** and **Smarty**, and how to work with the adult industry in general.

I was the only developer on the team, so I had to do everything myself and learn on the spot.

Additionally, with my experience in graphic design and video editing, I was also responsible for creating the banners and sometimes, videos for the websites.

## How I did it

**ElevatedX** as any big CMS uses templates for the frontend. The templates are written in **PHP** and **Smarty** (I hate Smarty with passion, by the way). However, while the CMS had a lot of video encoding features, it lacked other, general website functions, like searching, sorting, filtering, etc. I had to build all of these from scratch.

As it's all on top of **PHP**, it was fairly easy to learn it and implement these features. I've also used **jQuery** extensively. If I had to do this today, I would probably use a JS framework like React, but still use **PHP** for the backend. Overall, it was a lot of trial and error, but I was able to learn a lot and implement the features I needed.

Apart from the main website, I've also created a few other websites, which are all part of the same network. Additionally, I worked on the landing (join) pages for the websites, gallery pages, and more.

## Working in Adult

Working in the adult industry is not for everyone. It's a very specific industry and you need to have a certain mindset to work in it. I've learned a lot about the industry and I've also learned a lot about myself. I've also learned that I'm not a big fan of working alone. I prefer working in a team, where I can learn from others and share my knowledge with others.

Funny enough, a lot of cutting-edge technologies are being developed / seen first in the adult industry. For example, adult websites introduced video previews on hover. Now, it's a standard feature on most video websites.

At the same time, many of the adult websites that I saw, are stuck with retro and obsolete designs, circa 2010 or earlier. Not at all responsive and not at all user-friendly.

They still use tables for the layout and JPEG images. Designers really had it rough before, haven't they? The Flex and Grid CSS gods haven't bless them yet, apparently. ðŸ˜…

But I guess, if it works, why change it...
