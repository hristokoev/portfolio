I'm proud to say that I was accepted at [42 Prague](https://42prague.com/) after the month-long piscine in October 2022.

### Introduction

![](/images/42/thumb.jpg)

42 is a coding school that was founded in Paris, France. It's a school that doesn't have any teachers, but instead relies on peer-to-peer learning. It's a very unique school and I'm very happy to be a part of it.

### My Experience

I've been studying at 42 Prague since January 2023. I've learned a lot about C and Unix, but also about myself. I've learned how to learn, how to be more efficient, how to be more patient, and how to be more confident. I have to be honest, recently, I've been slackin' a bit, but I'm trying to get back on track. While my main goal is to be a succesful web developer, I would also like to learn more about C, low-level programming, and operating systems.

The social aspect of the school is also very important. I've met a lot of great, smart and inspiring people.
