This is my first (and only) After Effects template.

There was a time when I wanted to make it as a seller on VideoHive. Turns out, it's a lot of work and after this project, I really started to think twice about it.

### Preview

To see it in action, check out the preview video on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/351064986).

### Challenges

Writing about this now, I remember two big challenges that I had to overcome.

One was, modelling the phone in 3DS Max. It really took me some time, but I'm happy with the result. I really had to pay attention to make the folds look seamless.

The second challenge was setting up the controls of the phone in After Effects. I always knew AE had scripting capabilities, but I never really used them. So I had to create a plugin that would allow me to control the phone. This experience, thinking about it now, had opened my eyes to programing and I think it was one of the reasons I started to learn how to code.

Other stuff I had to do was baking HDRI maps for the reflections, actually doing sample videos and content for the screen, and animating the phone.

And I was really big on customization. Thinking about it now, I may have overdone it a bit.

### Conclusion

I'm overall glad with the result and I'm happy to say it made some sales on VideoHive. I'm not sure if I'll ever make another template, but I'm glad I did this one.
